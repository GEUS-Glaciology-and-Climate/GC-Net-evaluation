abstract:
As part of IPY-0732946, three automatic weather stations (Larsen 1, 2, 3) were installed along a latitudinal gradient on the Larsen C ice shelf.  The stations were installed in December 2008 (Larsen 3 AWS did not come online until 2009) and operated through the end of the project in November 2011.

Instruments and devices:
Campbell Scientific CR10X data logger 
Campbell Scientific TX312 GOES satellite transmitter
Vaisala PTB110 barometer for air pressure
Kipp & Zonen NR-Lite net radiometer on Larsen AWS 1
REBS net radiometer on Larsen AWS 2 and 3
Vaisala HMP45AC temperature and humidity sensors
RM Young 05103 wind sensors for wind speed and direction
Campbell Scientific LI-200X Li-Core Silicon Pyranometer
Campbell Scientific SR20A sonic ranging height sensors for snow depth
Campbell Scientific thermocouple air temperature sensors

Acquisition procedures:
Stations consisted of a single mast and two cross arms nominally at 2 and 3 m above the snow surface.  Due to snow accumulation, the actual height varied substantially.  The approximate height of the cross arms are reported in columns 45 and 46 of the data files (see C-level Format.pdf for more details).

The approximate location of the stations:
Larsen AWS 1: -68.142889°, -63.957417°
Larsen AWS 2: -67.562472°, -63.257667°
Larsen AWS 3: -67.031778°, -62.65025°

Description of data processing:
Data processing procedures are described here: https://cires1.colorado.edu/science/groups/steffen/gcnet/Gc-net_documentation_Nov_10_2000.pdf

Description of data content:
Three .csv files (one for each station) with individual columns corresponding to the attached C-level format documentation.


Limitations and issues:
General AWS issues experienced by the GC-NET are described here: https://cires1.colorado.edu/science/groups/steffen/gcnet/Gc-net_documentation_Nov_10_2000.pdf

Specific issues noted for these datasets:
Larsen 3 AWS incoming and outgoing SW radiation did not record correctly
Larsen 2 and 3 AWS net radiometers did not record correctly
One of the Larsen 3 AWS relative humidity sensors did not record correctly
The RH values have not been corrected for values >100% in sub-freezing conditions.  See this paper for more details: Makkonen and Laakso, 2005, Humidity measurements in cold and humid environments, Boundary-Layer Meteorology, 116, 131-147. DOI: 10.1007/s10546-004-7955-y.
Snow temperature thermistors were not included with these stations (columns 20-29).


Checkboxes:
* All the data are referenced in time and space.
* The data column, properties, and attributes listed/used in the data files are explained either in the description and/or the data files themselves.
* Graphs and maps (if provided) have legends.
